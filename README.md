# OpenLinkedIn

This app handles LinkedIn's proprietary `linkedin://#profile` URL and opens the default web browser to show that person's LinkedIn profile. You get these proprietary URLs as your contacts' home page when you use the iOS app to import your LinkedIn connections into your contact list and then sync the iOS contacts into your Mac.

## How to use it

1. [Download the app](http://adib.github.com/OpenLinkedIn/downloads/OpenLinkedIn.zip).
2. Move it to the Applications folder.
3. Run it once.

It doesn't have any UI but running it ensure that the app is registered to the system's LaunchServices database.

The next time you click on a `linkedin://#profile/xxxx` URL, it should open the contact's LinkedIn profile in your default web browser.
